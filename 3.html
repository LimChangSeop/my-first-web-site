  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based, scripting programming language. The language is primarily used within a web browser and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and eventually JavaScript. While JavaScript has some similarities in syntax to Sun Microsystems' Java, this is actually because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and the direct association between Java and JavaScript is weak. Other than the name and phrase, there are more similarities to self or scheme than to Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specification of ECMAScript (ECMAScript) and was natively supported by most browsers until ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but after ECMAScript 6 it is compiled into a transpiler for browser compatibility.
