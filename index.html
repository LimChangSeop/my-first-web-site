  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a worldwide information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet. It's often called simply the Web. The term is often synonymous with the Internet, but strictly speaking, it is a different concept. The Web is just one service that runs on the Internet, like e-mail. Since 1993, however, the Web has occupied an absolute place in the structure of the Internet.

It is also used on the Internet to transfer pictures and characters using the HTTP protocol, hypertext, and HTML format.
